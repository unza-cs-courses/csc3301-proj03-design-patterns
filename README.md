# Project 3: Design Patterns Library

**CSC3301 Programming Language Paradigms**  
**Weight:** 5.5% | **Duration:** 3 weeks

## Overview
Design and implement a reusable library demonstrating classic design patterns in Python.

## Core Patterns (Required)
1. **Factory Method** - Creational
2. **Observer** - Behavioral
3. **Strategy** - Behavioral

## Variant Patterns
Check `variant.json` for your 2 additional patterns from:
- Creational: Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton
- Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Facade
- Behavioral: Command, State, Template Method

## Requirements
- Each pattern needs abstract base + 2 concrete implementations
- Practical example demonstrating the pattern
- Unit tests with ≥90% coverage for each pattern
- UML diagrams in `docs/uml/`

## Milestones
| M1 | Factory Method | 20% |
| M2 | Observer + Strategy | 30% |
| M3 | Variant patterns | 30% |
| Final | Documentation + UML | 20% |
